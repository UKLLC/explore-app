SEROLOGY_v0001_20220302,A4,Indicates whether data is from test for anti-Nucelocapsid (Antibody_N) or anti-Spike (Antibody_S) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies,2022-03-26 22:56:51.230
SEROLOGY_v0001_20220302,A5,"Represents the date (DD/MM/YYYY) the laboratory received the sample (accession_date' in raw data we received). Note that that ItemDate should be earlier than SampleReceivedORTestedDate. However  it is not the case for a minority of participants. For analysis  we suggest to use whichever date was earlier for each participant.,2022-03-26 22:56:51.230 TWINSUK_SEROLOGY_v0001_20220309,A6,The anti-S test range was 0.4-250 U/mL for Thriva #1 and 0.4-25000 U/mL for Thriva #2 and the positive threshold was 0.8 U/mL. The anti-N positive threshold is 1.0 COI but values should not be interpreted quantitatively. Raw data were from Roche Elecsys assays (https://diagnostics.roche.com/gb/en/products/params/elecsys-anti-sars-cov-2.html).",2022-03-26 22:56:51.230
