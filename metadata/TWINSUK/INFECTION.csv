1217954,TWINSUK,INFECTION,a2,"NaturalInfection_WideCDC_Interpretation_MaxToDate. Serology-based SARS-CoV-2 natural infection status based on all available lab antibody and antigen tests. Tests interpreted based on CDC guidance taking into account individual's vaccination status at time of testing. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/antibody-tests-guidelines.html. 
Evidence of natural infection: Positive anti-S antibody before vaccination or positive anti-N at any time or positive antigen test at any time
No evidence of natural infection: All anti-N and antigen test results negative and anti-S before vaccination negative. Anti-S after vaccination can be negative or positive - positive results assumed to be due to immune response caused by vaccination. 
Possible evidence: When anti-S positive but vaccination status at time of testing is unknown (vaccination status relies on self-reported dates of vaccinations).  
No antibody results to interpret: Individual has no non-void lab-tests available to generate status

The serology-based infection status was generated using both Roche ELISA tests and earlier anti-N and anti-S ELISA antibody results performed in King's College London labs between April 2020 and May 2021. 

Raw data were from Roche Elecsys assays (https://diagnostics.roche.com/gb/en/products/params/elecsys-anti-sars-cov-2.html). ",999906.0,No data available
